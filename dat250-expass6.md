## Experiment 2 and 3

Frontend for the todo api developed as a SPA in angular.
It implements GET, POST and DELETE

Api runned by `./mvnw spring-boot:run` and SPA is runned by `npm start`

I had some issues with the todo ids where some ids last digits where cut off in the browser. I changed the code to store ids as strings, and the application worked as expected
